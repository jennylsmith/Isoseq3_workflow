Term,Explanation
FSM,Full Splice Match. PacBio transcripts matching a reference transcript at all splice junctions or PacBio monoexon transcripts matching a monoexon reference
ISM,"Incomplete Splice Match. PacBio transcripts matching consecutive, but not all, of the splice junctions of a reference transcript or PacBio monoexon transcripts matching a multiexon reference"
UTR3 Fragment,Subtype of ISM transcripts that are contained by 95% or more in the 3’ UTR of a reference
NIC,Novel In Catalog. PacBio novel transcripts that contain new combinations of known Splice Junctions or PacBio novel transcripts that contain novel junctions formed from already annotated donors and acceptors
NNC,Novel Not in Catalog. PacBio novel transcripts that contain novel junctions formed from novel donors and/or acceptors
Genic intron,PacBio novel transcripts lying entirely within the boundaries of an annotated intron. They are considered in the manuscript novel genes
Intergenic,PacBio novel transcripts lying entirely out of the boundaries of any annotated locus. They are considered in the manuscript novel genes.
Genic Genomic,PacBio novel transcripts overlapping partially an annotated intron and an annotated exon
Fusion Transcripts,PacBio novel transcripts overlapping partially at least two different loci
Antisense,PacBio novel transcripts overlapping at least partially an annotated transcript in the contrary strand
MET,Most Expressed Transcript of a gene. The transcript with the highest mean expression across samples for a given gene
