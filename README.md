# Isoseq3_workflow

Author: Jenny Smith



We have a total of 12 (11 AML, 1 Normal Bone Marrow) different biological samples to be sequenced across 26 SMRT-cells.  There are 4 SMRT-cells for the NBM.  Each AML sample is sequenced across 2 SMRT-cells (a large cDNA prep on 1 cell, and small cDNA prep on the 2nd cell).

We used 96 barcoded oligonucleotides for the RT-PCR step, to provide a means for PCR duplicate detection. Each SMRT-cell contains a single sample's library (not multiplexed by sample).

#General Workflow
1. ccs generation
2. demultiplex the barcoded primers
3.
